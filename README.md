# Credits
this approach was heavily inspired by this very helpful article:
* http://www.knowceantech.com/2014/03/amazon-cloud-bootstrap-with-userdata-cloudinit-github-puppet/
and the wonderful Vagrant-DSpace project (to which it is my pleasure to be a contributor)

Cloud-Init Hints (some acquired from the article above, others gathered in additional research)
* Some examples at: http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/examples.html
